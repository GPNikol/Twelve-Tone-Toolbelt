# TwelveTone

Twelve-tone music - also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and twelve-note composition
is a method of musical composition devised by Arnold Schoenberg and typically associated with
"Second Viennese School" composers. Over time the technique grew in popularity and became widely
influential on 20th-century composers such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky. 

The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often
as one another in a piece of music while preventing emphasis on any one note through the use of
tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. This prevents the music from being in any key. 

To meet the requirements of a tone row the set must meet these preconditions:

1. The row is a specific ordering of all twelve notes on the chromatic scale 
   (with no regard to octave placement.)
2. No note is to be repeated within a row.
3. The row may be subjected to interval-preserving transformations.
   That is may appear inverted, retrograde, or retrograde-inversion.
4. The row in any of it's transformations may begin on any degree of the chromatic scale - 
   In other words it may be freely transposed.

This software was created to assist modern composers with the creation of their twelve-tone matrix.
All the user needs to do is create their prime row and press the build button to see the full matrix.
Once the matrix is built the user can convert the display of the matrix to any of five representations.

The default display is numerical where each number 0 through 11 represents each step of the scale C through Bâ™­.

The alpha-numeric display has each number 0 through 9, ten and eleven are represented by t and e respectively.

The flat alphabetic display uses the musical note representation with flats rather than sharps.

The sharp alphabetic display uses the musical note representation with sharps rather than flats. 

The expanded representation shows the musical distance between each note in the tone row. 

# Project Checklist

~~1. Create and display a twelve tone matrix in five representations.~~

~~2. Create a GUI for the twelve tone matrix.~~

3. Enable saving of the currently display twelve-tone matrix.

4. Enable saving of the state of the workspace.

~~5. Enable printing of the current state of the twelve-tone matrix.~~

6. Enable display options to alter the appearence of the workspace.

7. Add audio to play a line in the twelve-tone matrix.
