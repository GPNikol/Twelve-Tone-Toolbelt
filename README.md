# TwelveTone

Twelve-tone music - also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and twelve-note composition
is a method of musical composition devised by Arnold Schoenberg and typically associated with
"Second Viennese School" composers. Over time the technique grew in popularity and became widely
influential on 20th-century composers such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky. 

The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often
as one another in a piece of music while preventing emphasis on any one note through the use of
tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. This prevents the music from being in any key. 

To meet the requirements of a tone row the set must meet these preconditions:

1. The row is a specific ordering of all twelve notes on the chromatic scale 
   (with no regard to octave placement.)
2. No note is to be repeated within a row.
3. The row may be subjected to interval-preserving transformations.
   That is may appear inverted, retrograde, or retrograde-inversion.
4. The row in any of it's transformations may begin on any degree of the chromatic scale - 
   In other words it may be freely transposed.
